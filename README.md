# SWCH-Calendar

SWCH Calendar is a personal project for practicing the process of app development using Android Studio. 
It is an all-in-one Android app prototype designed to bring the best of notes, to-do tasks, and calendar events together.

Developers began the process with ideation & design. 
They then formed two groups of two for a "front-end" interface design team and a "back-end" database development team. 
Finally, both groups convened for integration of the front and back. 

The development process is still in progress.
